## Why you might want to hire me

I am a self-driven and curious manual tester in training. I have completed an intense 8-week-long DareIT course for manual testing and am currently looking for opportunities to kick start my career in IT. For the past 5.5 years I have been working as a business presentations specialist. Now I want to continue my passion for detail as a tester. Exchange seeking crooked lines for finding out bugs! I could describe myself as self-reliant, ambitious and engaged. I value team work greatly and think good relations are extremely important for enabling good collaboration. I find myself naturally attracted to working as an individual, but am also greatly rewarded with pride of completing tasks together as a team! 

## Experience

I found it a natural step for me to take up manual testing after 5.5 years of experience in creating high-profile business presentations. The drive for quality, attention to great customer experience, obsession with detail to ensure the best final delivery have been my personal brand for the past years. DareIT challenge for manual testing has allowed me to dive into the world of tech and work hands on with different tools with the helping hand of great teachers. It has showed me the importance of staying curious and digging relentlessly to find out the reason behind things. The weekly tasks I completed have proven I am able to work towards tight deadlines and organize my work well. They have also highlighted that I am self-reliant and am able to seek solutions on my own.
